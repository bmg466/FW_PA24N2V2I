# FW_PA24N2V2I
Firmware for STM8L152C8T6 mounted on preamplefier PA24N2V2I, in project used UART1, ADC, DAC, I2C;

UART1 for communicate with client (hope to make application on QT for Windows and Linux);
ADC for monitoring thresholds of the preamp, monitoring for source voltage (+2.5V);
DAC for controlling threshold by adjusting the lower threshold;
I2C for monitoring temperature on the PCB (hottest point) and in the gas space via AD7415

Would appreciate any comments or suggestions that will help to improve code;
